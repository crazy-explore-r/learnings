    <h1>What is Product Management?</h1>

    <p>Product management is a multifaceted discipline that forms the backbone of any technology organization. As a
        product manager, individuals are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the
        cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it. This entails an understanding of the market, the
        competitive landscape, customer demand and preferences, as well as business strategy. The decisions made by the
        product manager directly influence the strategic direction, design, functionality, and commercial success of the
        product. They essentially form a bridge between different teams, such as engineering, design, marketing, sales,
        and customer support, ensuring a seamless transition from product development to product release.
