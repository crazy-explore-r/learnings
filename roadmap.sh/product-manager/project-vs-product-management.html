    <h1>Project vs Product Management</h1>

    <p>Project management focuses on planning, executing, and closing specific projects with defined objectives,
        timelines, and deliverables, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and within budget. It is concerned with
        the successful completion of a project, often involving temporary endeavors with a clear beginning and end. In
        contrast, product management is a continuous process that involves the entire lifecycle of a product, from
        ideation and development to market launch and ongoing improvements.</p>

    <p>Product managers are responsible for defining the product vision, strategy, and roadmap, ensuring that the
        product meets customer needs and business goals. They work cross-functionally with teams like engineering,
        marketing, and sales to deliver a product that provides value over its entire lifecycle. While project managers
        focus on the execution of specific initiatives, product managers concentrate on the long-term success and
        evolution of a product.</p>
